# Simple Employee Record System for Project Management

This is a simple Python-based program to help project managers keep track of temporary employees involved in a project.

## Problem

In many projects, managers need to handle a number of temporary workers. However, it's often hard to manage and record their:

- **Attendance**
- **Performance-based salary adjustments**
- **Project assignments**
- **Roles in specific projects**

Some workers may not yet be fully registered in the project, or their roles are still unclear. Without a system, managers may struggle to track who is working on what, how often they are present, and how much they should be paid.

## Solution

This program provides a simple terminal-based system where a project manager can:

- Add and view employee records
- Record attendance
- Track which project a worker belongs to and what role they have
- Make simple performance-based salary changes
- Update or remove employees as needed

The goal is to give managers a lightweight and easy-to-use tool to help organize temporary worker data during a project.
