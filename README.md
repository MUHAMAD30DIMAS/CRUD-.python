# Simple Employee Record System for Project Management

A lightweight, terminalâ€‘based Python application designed to help project managers efficiently manage temporary employees, including tracking attendance, roles, and performanceâ€‘based salary adjustments.

## Challenges Faced

Managing project-based temporary staff often poses these challenges:

- âœ… Add, View, Update, and Delete employee records

- ðŸ•’ Log daily attendance

- ðŸ‘¥ Assign employees to projects with specific roles

- ðŸ’µ Apply performance-based salary adjustments

- ðŸ—‘ Remove records when employees leave or data becomes outdated

All operations are terminal-based, making the system fast, accessible, and easy to deploy.
